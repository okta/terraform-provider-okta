        ### A Note on Terraform Core Issues

        We also ask that you consider whether your issue may be related to Terraform Core. If you are running into one of the following scenarios, we recommend [opening an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/new/choose) in the Terraform Core repository instead:

        * [Configuration Language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language) or resource ordering issues
        * [State](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) and [State Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend) issues
        * [Provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) issues
        * [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
        * Issues that span resources across multiple providers

        * the version of the config before the change, and
        * the version of the config after the change.
