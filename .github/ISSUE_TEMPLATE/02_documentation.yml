        ## Thank you for raising a documentation issue!

        This form is meant to alert the maintainers to issues with the provider documentation found on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest) (such as resource and data source documentation, guides, and examples), or the [contributors guide](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

        We ask that you first [search existing issues](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta/labels/documentation-bug) and [pull requests](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta/pulls) to see if someone else may have already noticed the same issue or has already submitted a fix for it.
