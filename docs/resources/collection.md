# Resource: okta_collection

Manages an Okta Governance Collection. This resource allows you to create and configure an Okta [Collection](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Collections/).

Collections are used to group multiple resources (applications) with their entitlements, which can then be assigned to principals (users or groups). When a collection is assigned to a principal, POLICY grants are automatically created in the background.

~> **Note:** This resource requires Okta Governance (Okta Identity Governance - OIG) to be enabled in your Okta organization.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "okta_collection" "slack_permissions" {
  name        = "Slack Bot Permissions"
  description = "Entitlements for in-house Slack bot"
}
```

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import an Okta Collection using its ID. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = okta_collection.example
  id = "col123abc"
}
```

Otherwise, import an Okta Collection using its ID with the `terraform import` command:

```shell
terraform import okta_collection.example col123abc
```
