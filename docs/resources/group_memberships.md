description: |-
  Resource to manage a set of memberships for a specific group.
  This resource will allow you to bulk manage group membership in Okta for a given
  group. This offers an interface to pass multiple users into a single resource
  call, for better API resource usage. If you need a relationship of a single
  user to many groups, please use the 'oktausergroupmemberships' resource.
  Important: The default behavior of the resource is to only maintain the
  state of user ids that are assigned it. This behavior will signal drift only if
  those users stop being part of the group. If the desired behavior is track all
  users that are added/removed from the group make use of the 'trackall_users'
  argument with this resource.
