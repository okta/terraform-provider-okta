# Resource: okta_group_owners

Note: The okta_group_owners resource uses repeated owner blocks. This is equivalent to a list of owners, but is more readable in HCL.

Manage all or a tracked subset of owners for an Okta group.

- The resource ID is the Okta group ID.
- By default (track_all_owners = true), the resource is authoritative over the declared owners. Removals of owners that aren’t declared in configuration occur during reconciliation after the resource exists in state (i.e., on subsequent refresh/plan/apply), ensuring the Terraform plan remains accurate.
- Set track_all_owners = false to opt-out of removing owners that are not managed by this resource.

### Plan accuracy

### Interactions with other resources

Avoid managing the same group’s owners with both okta_group_owner and okta_group_owners when track_all_owners = true. The okta_group_owners resource may remove owners that are not declared in its configuration. If you must mix, either set track_all_owners = false for okta_group_owners, or ensure all intended owners are declared in okta_group_owners.

On initial creation, Terraform cannot enumerate deletions of pre-existing, non-declared owners because they are not yet in state. If you need an explicit plan showing which owners will be removed, import the current owners first, then run plan:

```sh
terraform import okta_group_owners.owners <group_id>
terraform plan
```

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "okta_user" "owner1" {
  first_name = "Alice"
  last_name  = "Owner"
  login      = "alice-owner@example.com"
  email      = "alice-owner@example.com"
}

resource "okta_user" "owner2" {
  first_name = "Bob"
  last_name  = "Owner"
  login      = "bob-owner@example.com"
  email      = "bob-owner@example.com"
}

resource "okta_group" "grp" {
  name = "demo-group"
}

resource "okta_group_owners" "owners" {
  group_id = okta_group.grp.id

  owner {
    type = "USER"
    id   = okta_user.owner1.id
  }
  owner {
    type = "USER"
    id   = okta_user.owner2.id
  }

  # Optional: set to false to avoid removing non-tracked owners
  # track_all_owners = false
}
```
