# Resource: okta_hook_key

Creates and manages a Hook Key. This resource allows you to create and configure an Okta [Hook Key](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/hook-keys/) for use with Inline Hooks.

Hook Keys are public/private key pairs that are used to authenticate webhook requests from Okta to your application. When you create a Hook Key, Okta generates a public/private key pair and stores the public key. You can then use the public key to verify the authenticity of webhook requests.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "okta_hook_key" "example" {
  name = "My Hook Key"
}
```

```terraform
# Create a Hook Key
resource "okta_hook_key" "example" {
  name = "My Hook Key"
}
