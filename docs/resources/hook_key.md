# Resource: okta_hook_key

Creates and manages a Hook Key. This resource allows you to create and configure an Okta [Hook Key](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/hook-keys/).

Use Key Management to create and manage JSON Web Keys (JWKS) that support OAuth 2.0 client authentication. The key is composed of a public and private key pair. The private key signs the JSON Web Token (JWT) and the public key validates it on the client side.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "okta_hook_key" "example" {
  name = "My Hook Key"
}
```
