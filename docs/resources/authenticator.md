# Resource: okta_authenticator

~> **WARNING:** This feature is only available as a part of the Identity Engine. [Contact support](mailto:dev-inquiries@okta.com) for further information.

This resource allows you to configure different authenticators.

-> **Create:** The Okta API has an odd notion of create for authenticators. If
the authenticator doesn't exist then a one time 'POST /api/v1/authenticators' to
create the authenticator (hard create) will be performed. Thereafter, that
authenticator is never deleted, it is only deactivated (soft delete). Therefore,
if the authenticator already exists create is just a soft import of an existing
authenticator. This does not apply to custom_otp and custom_app authenticators. 
There can be multiple custom_otp authenticators. To create new custom_otp 
authenticator, a new name and key = custom_otp is required. If an old name is 
used, it will simply reactivate the old custom_otp authenticator. For custom_app 
authenticators, legacy_ignore_name must be set to false.

-> **Update:** custom_otp authenticator cannot be updated

-> **Delete:** Authenticators can not be truly deleted therefore delete is soft.
Delete will attempt to deativate the authenticator. An authenticator can only be
deactivated if it's not in use by any other policy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "okta_authenticator" "test" {
  name = "Security Question"
  key  = "security_question"
  settings = jsonencode(
    {
      "allowedFor" : "recovery"
    }
  )
}

resource "okta_authenticator" "otp" {
  name   = "Custom OTP"
  key    = "custom_otp"
  status = "ACTIVE"
  settings = jsonencode({
    "protocol" : "TOTP",
    "acceptableAdjacentIntervals" : 3,
    "timeIntervalInSeconds" : 30,
    "encoding" : "base32",
    "algorithm" : "HMacSHA256",
    "passCodeLength" : 6
  })
  // required to be false for custom_otp
  legacy_ignore_name = false
}

resource "okta_authenticator" "custom_app" {
  key                = "custom_app"
  name               = "Custom Push Auth"
  status             = "ACTIVE"
  agree_to_terms     = true
  legacy_ignore_name = false  // must be false for custom_app
  settings = jsonencode({
    userVerification = "REQUIRED"
    appInstanceId    = "0oasontedmcepr0Uf1d7"
  })
  provider_json = jsonencode({
    type = "PUSH"
    configuration = {
      fcm = {
        id = "ppcrb12345678ABCDEF"
      }
    }
  })
}

## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) A human-readable string that identifies the authenticator. Some authenticators are available by feature flag on the organization. Possible values inclue: `custom_app`, `custom_otp`, `duo`, `external_idp`, `google_otp`, `okta_email`, `okta_password`, `okta_verify`, `onprem_mfa`, `phone_number`, `rsa_token`, `security_question`, `webauthn`
- `name` (String) Display name of the Authenticator

### Optional

- `agree_to_terms` (Boolean) A value of true indicates that the administrator accepts the terms for creating a new authenticator. Okta requires that you accept the terms when creating a new custom_app authenticator. Other authenticators don't require this field.
- `legacy_ignore_name` (Boolean) Name does not trigger change detection (legacy behavior). Must be set to false for custom_app authenticators.
- `provider_auth_port` (Number) The RADIUS server port (for example 1812). This is defined when the On-Prem RADIUS server is configured. Used only for authenticators with type `security_key`.  Conflicts with `provider_json` argument.
- `provider_host` (String) (DUO specific) - The Duo Security API hostname. Conflicts with `provider_json` argument.
- `provider_hostname` (String) Server host name or IP address. Default is `localhost`. Used only for authenticators with type `security_key`. Conflicts with `provider_json` argument.
- `provider_integration_key` (String) (DUO specific) - The Duo Security integration key.  Conflicts with `provider_json` argument.
- `provider_json` (String) Provider JSON allows for expressive providervalues. This argument conflicts with the other 'provider_xxx' arguments. The [CreateProvider](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authenticators-admin/#request) illustrates detailed provider values for a Duo authenticator. [Provider values](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authenticators-admin/#authenticators-administration-api-object)are listed in Okta API.
- `provider_secret_key` (String) (DUO specific) - The Duo Security secret key.  Conflicts with `provider_json` argument.
- `provider_shared_secret` (String, Sensitive) An authentication key that must be defined when the RADIUS server is configured, and must be the same on both the RADIUS client and server. Used only for authenticators with type `security_key`. Conflicts with `provider_json` argument.
- `provider_user_name_template` (String) Username template expected by the provider. Used only for authenticators with type `security_key`.  Conflicts with `provider_json` argument.
- `settings` (String) Settings for the authenticator. The settings JSON contains values based on Authenticator key. It is not used for authenticators with type `security_key`
- `status` (String) Authenticator status: `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. Default: `ACTIVE`

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `provider_instance_id` (String) App Instance ID.
- `provider_type` (String) Provider type. Supported value for Duo: `DUO`. Supported value for Custom App: `PUSH`
- `type` (String) he type of Authenticator. Values include: `password`, `security_question`, `phone`, `email`, `app`, `federated`, and `security_key`.
