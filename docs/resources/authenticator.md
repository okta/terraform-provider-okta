This resource allows you to configure different authenticators.

-> **Create:** The Okta API has an odd notion of create for authenticators. If
the authenticator doesn't exist then a one time 'POST /api/v1/authenticators' to
create the authenticator (hard create) will be performed. Thereafter, that
authenticator is never deleted, it is only deactivated (soft delete). Therefore,
if the authenticator already exists create is just a soft import of an existing
authenticator.

-> **Delete:** Authenticators can not be truly deleted therefore delete is soft.
Delete will attempt to deativate the authenticator. An authenticator can only be
deactivated if it's not in use by any other policy.
