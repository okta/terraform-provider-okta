~> **WARNING:** This feature is only available as a part of the Identity Engine. [Contact support](mailto:dev-inquiries@okta.com) for further information.

This resource allows you to configure different authenticators.

-> **Create:** The Okta API has an odd notion of create for authenticators. If
the authenticator doesn't exist then a one time 'POST /api/v1/authenticators' to
create the authenticator (hard create) will be performed. Thereafter, that
authenticator is never deleted, it is only deactivated (soft delete). Therefore,

-> **Update:** custom_otp authenticator cannot be updated

-> **Delete:** Authenticators can not be truly deleted therefore delete is soft.
Delete will attempt to deativate the authenticator. An authenticator can only be
deactivated if it's not in use by any other policy.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  name = "Security Question"
  key  = "security_question"
  settings = jsonencode(

      "allowedFor" : "recovery"
    }
  )
}

resource "okta_authenticator" "otp" {
  name   = "Custom OTP"
  key    = "custom_otp"
  status = "ACTIVE"
  settings = jsonencode({
    "protocol" : "TOTP",
    "acceptableAdjacentIntervals" : 3,
    "timeIntervalInSeconds" : 30,
    "encoding" : "base32",
    "algorithm" : "HMacSHA256",
    "passCodeLength" : 6
  })
  // required to be false for custom_otp
  legacy_ignore_name = false
