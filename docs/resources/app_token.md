# Resource: okta_app_token

Resource to manage OAuth 2.0 tokens for an app.

~> **NOTE:** This resource is import-only. Refresh tokens cannot be created through Terraform as they are generated by refresh flows. You can only import existing tokens and manage their lifecycle (revocation).

~> **WARNING:** The `Update` operation is not supported. Any changes to the token configuration will be ignored, and Terraform will retain the existing state.

## Example Usage

### Import and Manage Existing Token

```hcl
# Import an existing refresh token
resource "okta_app_token" "example" {
  client_id = "0oardd5r32PWsF4421d7"
  id        = "oar1godmqw4QUiX4C1d7"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `client_id` - (Required) The unique Okta ID of the application associated with this token. This is typically the `client_id` of an refresh application.
* `id` - (Required) The unique Okta ID of the refresh token.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `user_id` - The unique Okta ID of the user associated with this token.
* `status` - The current status of the token (e.g., `ACTIVE`, `REVOKED`).

## Import

Refresh tokens can be imported using the format `{client_id}/{token_id}`:

```bash
terraform import okta_app_token.example 0oardd5r32PWsF4421d7/oar1godmqw4QUiX4C1d7
```

Where:
- `0oardd5r32PWsF4421d7` is the application's client_id
- `oar1godmqw4QUiX4C1d7` is the Refresh token ID
