# Resource: okta_admin_role_targets



Manages targets for administrator roles.

This resource allows you to define permissions for admin roles into a smaller subset of Groups or Apps within your org.
You can define admin roles to target Groups, Applications, and Application Instances.

```
Note 1: you have to assign a role to a user before creating this resource.

Note 2: You can target a mixture of both App and App Instance targets, but can't assign permissions to manage all
        instances of an App and then a subset of that same App. For example, you can't specify that an admin has access
        to manage all instances of a Salesforce app and then also specific configurations of the Salesforce app.
```


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "okta_admin_role_targets" "example" {
  user_id   = "<user_id>"
  role_type = "APP_ADMIN"
  apps      = ["oidc_client.<app_id>", "facebook"]
}
```
