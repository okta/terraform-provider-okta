# Resource: okta_app_access_policy_assignment

Manages assignment of Access Policy to an Application. 
		
**Warning**: do not use as this will update okta_app_*.authentication_policy and vice versa

Assigns an access policy (colloquially known as a sign-on policy and/or an
authentication policy) to an application. This resource does not perform true
delete as it will not delete an application and the app's access policy can't be
removed; it can only be changed to a different access policy. This resource is
only logical within the context of an application therefore `app_id` is
immutable once set. Use this resource to manage assigning an access policy to an
application. It will assign the given `policy_id` to the application at creation
and during update.

-> Inside the product a sign-on policy is referenced as an _authentication
policy_, in the public API the policy is of type
[`ACCESS_POLICY`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-object).


## Example Usage

}

resource "okta_app_access_policy_assignment" "assignment" {
  app_id    = data.okta_app.example.id
  policy_id = data.okta_policy.access.id
}
