# Resource: okta_end_user_my_requests

Manages an End User Request in Okta Identity Governance. This resource allows you to create access requests on behalf of end users through the Okta Identity Governance system.

This resource creates access requests with the specified requester field values and tracks the status of the request. The resource does not support updates or deletions - requests must be managed through the Okta Dashboard after creation.

-> **Note:** This resource is part of Okta Identity Governance functionality and requires appropriate licensing and configuration.

**Important Limitations:**
- **Update Not Supported**: This resource does not support updates. To modify a request, you must cancel it via the Okta Dashboard and recreate the resource.
- **Delete Not Supported**: This resource does not support deletions. Requests must be cancelled via the Okta Dashboard.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "okta_end_user_my_requests" "example" {
  entry_id = "cen123456789abcdefgh"
  requester_field_values {
    id    = "abcdefgh-0123-4567-8910-hgfedcba123"
    type  = "TEXT"
    value = "I need access to complete my certification."
  }
  requester_field_values {
    id    = "ijklmnop-a12b2-c3d4-e5f6-abcdefghi"
    type  = "DURATION"
    value = "For 5 days"
  }
  requester_field_values {
    id    = "tuvwxyz-0123-456-8910-zyxwvut0123"
    type  = "SELECT"
    value = "Yes"
  }
}
```

### Example with Multi-Select Values

```terraform
resource "okta_end_user_my_requests" "multi_select_example" {
  entry_id = "cen123456789abcdefgh"
  requester_field_values {
    id     = "multi-select-field-id"
    type   = "MULTISELECT"
    label  = "Select multiple options"
    values = ["Option1", "Option2", "Option3"]
  }
  requester_field_values {
    id    = "text-field-id"
    type  = "TEXT"
    value = "Additional justification text"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `entry_id` (String) The ID of the catalog entry for which the request is being made.

### Optional

- `id` (String) The id of the request. If not specified, it will be computed after the request is created.
- `requester_field_values` (Block List) The requester input fields required by the approval system. Note: The fields required are determined by the approval system. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--requester_field_values))

### Read-Only

- `status` (String) The status of the request. Possible values include: `APPROVED`, `CANCELED`, `DENIED`, `EXPIRED`, `PENDING`, `REJECTED`, `SUBMITTED`

<a id="nestedblock--requester_field_values"></a>
### Nested Schema for `requester_field_values`

#### Required

- `id` (String) The ID of a requesterField. This identifies the specific field in the approval system.

#### Optional

- `label` (String) A human-readable description of requesterField. It's used for display purposes and is optional.
- `type` (String) Type of value for the requester field. Valid values: `DURATION`, `ISO_DATE`, `MULTISELECT`, `OKTA_USER_ID`, `SELECT`, `TEXT`.
- `value` (String) The value of requesterField, which depends on the type of the field. Used for single-value fields.
- `values` (List of String) The values of requesterField with the type MULTISELECT. If the field type is MULTISELECT, this property is required instead of `value`.

## Field Type Guidelines

### Field Type Usage

- **TEXT**: Use `value` for free-form text input
- **SELECT**: Use `value` for single selection from predefined options
- **MULTISELECT**: Use `values` (list) for multiple selections from predefined options
- **DURATION**: Use `value` for time duration specifications (e.g., "5 days", "2 weeks")
- **ISO_DATE**: Use `value` for date specifications in ISO format
- **OKTA_USER_ID**: Use `value` for Okta user identifiers

### Important Notes

- For `MULTISELECT` type fields, you must use the `values` attribute instead of `value`
- The `id` field is always required and must match the field ID defined in the approval system
- The `label` and `type` fields are optional but recommended for clarity
- Field requirements and validation are determined by the approval system configuration

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import okta_end_user_my_requests.example <request_id/entry_id>
```

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **No Updates**: Once created, requests cannot be updated through Terraform. Any changes require cancelling the request via Okta Dashboard and recreating.

2. **No Deletions**: Requests cannot be deleted through Terraform. Use the Okta Dashboard to cancel requests.

3. **Field Dependencies**: The required fields and their types are determined by the approval system configuration in Okta Identity Governance.

4. **Status Tracking**: The `status` field is read-only and reflects the current state of the request in the approval workflow.

5. **Identity Governance Licensing**: This resource requires Okta Identity Governance licensing and proper configuration.
