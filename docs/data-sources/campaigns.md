# Data Source: okta_campaigns

Lists all or a subset of campaigns in your organization. Use the `filter` parameter to narrow results by name, status, scheduleType, reviewerType, and recurringCampaignId. Use `order_by` to sort by name, created, startDate, endDate, or status. By default, results are sorted by created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# List all campaigns
data "okta_campaigns" "test" {}

# Filter by status
data "okta_campaigns" "active" {
  filter = "status eq \"ACTIVE\""
}

# Limit and order
data "okta_campaigns" "recent" {
  limit    = 10
  order_by = ["created"]
}
```
