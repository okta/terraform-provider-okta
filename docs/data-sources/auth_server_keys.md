# Data Source: okta_auth_server_keys

Get a specific authorization server credential key from Okta. Authorization server keys are JSON Web Keys (JWK) used for signing tokens issued by the authorization server.

This data source allows you to retrieve information about a specific key used by an authorization server for token signing operations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "okta_auth_server_keys" "example" {
  auth_server_id = "aus123456789abcdefgh"
  key_id         = "abcdefghijk0123456789"
}
```

## Notes

- To find available key IDs for an authorization server, you can use the Okta Admin Console or make a direct API call to `/api/v1/authorizationServers/{authServerId}/credentials/keys`
- The key ID (`kid`) is automatically generated by Okta and is unique within the authorization server
- This data source is useful for retrieving key information for verification purposes or to reference in other configurations

## Schema

### Required

- `auth_server_id` (String) The ID of the authorization server.
- `key_id` (String) The ID of the certificate key.

### Read-Only

- `alg` (String) The algorithm used with the Key. Typically "RS256" for RSA keys.
- `e` (String) RSA key value (public exponent) for Key binding. Typically "AQAB".
- `id` (String) The internal identifier for this data source, required by Terraform to track state. This field does not exist in the Okta API response.
- `kid` (String) Unique identifier for the key (Key ID).
- `n` (String) RSA modulus value that is used by both the public and private keys and provides a link between them.
- `status` (String) The status of the key. An ACTIVE key is used to sign tokens issued by the authorization server. Supported values: `ACTIVE`, `NEXT`, or `EXPIRED`. A NEXT key is the next key that the authorization server uses to sign tokens when keys are rotated. The NEXT key might not be listed if it hasn't been generated. An EXPIRED key is the previous key that the authorization server used to sign tokens. The EXPIRED key might not be listed if no key has expired or the expired key was deleted.
- `use` (String) Acceptable use of the key. Typically "sig" for signature operations.
