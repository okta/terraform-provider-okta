# Data Source: okta_hook_key

Use Key Management to create and manage JSON Web Keys (JWKS) that support OAuth 2.0 client authentication. The key is composed of a public and private key pair. The private key signs the JSON Web Token (JWT) and the public key validates it on the client side.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get hook key by ID
data "okta_hook_key" "example" {
  id = "abcdefghij0123456789"
}
```
