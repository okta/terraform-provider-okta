# okta_link_definition

Link definition operations allow you to manage the creation and removal of the link definitions. If you remove a link 
definition, links based on that definition are unavailable. Note that this resource is immutable, thus can not be modified.

~> **NOTE:** Links reappear if you recreate the definition. However, Okta is likely to change this behavior so that links don't reappear. Don't rely on this behavior in production environments.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "okta_link_definition" "example" {
  primary_name           = "emperor"
  primary_title          = "Emperor"
  primary_description    = "Hereditary ruler of the Imperium and the Known Universe"
  associated_name        = "sardaukar"
  associated_title       = "Sardaukar"
  associated_description = "Elite military force member"
}
```
