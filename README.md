# Terraform Provider for Okta

The Terraform Okta provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for the full lifecycle management of Okta resources.
This provider is maintained internally by the Okta development team.

### WARNING
We're working on releasing of the okta-terraform-provider v6.0.0, which will introduce support for managing a broader range of Okta resources beyond just management-related ones. Following that, we'd be deprecating the v5 versions of the okta-terraform-provider.

## Examples

All the resources and data sources has [one or more examples](./examples) to give you an idea of how to use this
provider to build your own Okta infrastructure. Provider's official documentation is located in the
[official terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs), or [here](./website/docs)
in form of raw markdown files.

# Development Environment Setup

The sections below will guide you through the requirements, upgrading, getting started, building with and contributing to
the Okta Terraform Provider.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.14.0 or newer (to run acceptance tests)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (to build the provider plugin)

## Upgrade

If you have been using version 3.x of the Okta Terraform Provider, please upgrade to the latest version to take advantage of
all the new features, fixes, and functionality. Please refer to this [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta/issues/1338)
for guidance on how to upgrade to version 4.x. Also, please check our [Releases](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta/releases) page for more details on major, minor, and patch updates. 

## Quick Start

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (please
check the [requirements](#requirements) before proceeding).

_Note:_ This project uses [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) making it safe to work with it outside
your existing [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). The instructions that follow assume a directory in your
home directory outside the standard GOPATH (i.e `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`).

Clone repository to: `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/; cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
$ git clone git@github.com:okta/terraform-provider-okta.git
...
```

Enter the provider directory and run `make tools`. This will install the needed tools for the provider.

```sh
$ make tools
```

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin`
directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-okta
...
```

## Testing the Provider

In order to test the provider, you can run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run. Please
read [Running an Acceptance Test](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-an-acceptance-test)
in the contribution guidelines for more information on usage.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

## Using the Provider

To use a released provider in your Terraform environment,
run [`terraform init`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) and Terraform will automatically install the
provider. To specify a particular provider version when installing released providers, see
the [Terraform documentation on provider versioning](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#version-provider-versions)
.

To instead use a custom-built provider in your Terraform environment (e.g. the provider binary from the build
instructions above), follow the instructions
to [install it as a plugin](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-plugins). After placing the
custom-built provider into your plugins' directory, run `terraform init` to initialize it.

For either installation method, documentation about the provider specific configuration options can be found on
the [provider's website](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs).
